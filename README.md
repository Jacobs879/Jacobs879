### Skills In Progress â˜•
Currently, my favorite programming languages are Java, Python, and Clojure, which i've worked with on some projects. Additionally, I'm expanding my skills in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, and SQL, exploring new technologies with the goal of strengthening my skill set as a developer.
